SpectraVis
==========

An interactive network visualization tool for exploring [functional brain connectivity](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Brain_connectivity) using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/).

SpectraVis allows you to:
+ examine how network dynamics change over time and frequency
+ compare local (statistical dependencies between a single pair of nodes) and global (statistical dependencies between all nodes) dynamics.
+ compare different types of functional connectivity measures (correlation, coherence).
+ compare between different subjects.
+ examine only within- or between-brain area connections
+ flip between multiple network views for better understanding of the network structure

See [this](http://ericdeno.com/research/SpectraVis/) for an example of SpectraVis in action and the [wiki](https://github.com/edeno/SpectraVis/wiki) for more information.

## Installation
To install SpectraVis, use Node.js and its package manager (npm):

1. Install Node.js using one of the [installers](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a terminal (Mac) or a Windows Command Prompt (`Start > All Programs > Accessories > Windows Command Prompt `)
3. Enter in the terminal or command prompt: `npm install spectravis --save`

Alternatively, you can [download](https://github.com/edeno/SpectraVis/archive/master.zip) the ZIP and extract the repository. Note that while this is faster, Node.js installation will provide additional tools for modifying and deploying the visualization.
